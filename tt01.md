# Pseudo-random number generator



* Author Thomas BÃ¶hm <thomas.bohm@gmail.com>
* Description Pseudo-random number generator using a 16-bit Fibonacci linear-feedback shift register
* [GitHub project](https://github.com/tcptomato/tinytapeout)
* [Wokwi project](https://wokwi.com/projects/341178154799333971)
* [Extra docs](https://github.com/tcptomato/tinytapeout//blob/main/README.md)
* Clock 0 Hz
* External hardware None

## How it works

16 flip flops are connected in a chain, and the output of some is XORed together and fed back into the first flip flop. The outputs that are XORed together are chosen in such a way as to give the longest possible cycle (2^16-1). All bits being zero is a special case and is treated separately (all negative outputs of the flip flops are ANDed together to generate a 1 as feedback).
On each clock pulse (pin 1) one new bit is generated. Setting load_en (pin 3) to HIGH allows the loading of a user defined value through the data_in pin (pin2). On each clock pulse one bit is read into the flip flop chain. When load_en (pin 3) is set to LOW the computed feedback bit is fed back into the flip flops.
The outputs of the last 8 flip flops are connected to the output pins. For each clock pulse a random bit is generated and the other 7 are shifted. 

## How to test

Set the switch for pin 1 so that the push button generates the clock. Press on it and see the output change on the hex display.
Using pin 2 and 3 a custom value can be loaded into the flip flops. 

## IO

# Fibonacci & Gold Code



* Author Daniel Estevez
* Description This project includes two independent designs: a design that calculates terms of the Fibonacci sequence and displays them in hex one character at a time on a 7-segment display, and a Gold code generator that generates the codes used by CCSDS X-band PN Delta-DOR.
* [GitHub project](https://github.com/daniestevez/tinytapeout-verilog)
* [Wokwi project](https://wokwi.com/projects/341164910646919762)
* [Extra docs]()
* Clock 0 Hz
* External hardware No external hardware is needed

## How it works

The Fibonacci calculator uses 56-bit integers, so the terms of the Fibonacci sequence are displayed using 7 hex characters. Since the TinyTapeout PCB only has one 7-segment display, the terms of the Fibonacci sequence are displayed one hex character at a time, in LSB order. The dot of the 7-segment display lights up whenever the LSB is being displayed. On each clock cycle, 4-bits of the next Fibonacci term are calculated using a 4-bit adder, and 4-bits of the current term are displayed in the 7-segment display. The 7-segment display is ANDed with the project clock, so that the digits flash on the display. The Gold code generator computes a CCSDS X-band PN Delta-DOR Gold code one bit at a time using LFSRs. The output bit is shown on the 7-segment display dot. 6-bits of the second LFSR can be loaded in parallel using 6 project inputs in order to be able to generate different sequences. One of the project inputs is used to select whether the 7-segment display dot is driven by the Fibonacci calculator or by the Gold code generator.

## How to test

The project can be tested by manually driving the clock using a push button or switch. Just by de-asserting the reset and driving the clock, the digits of the Fibonacci sequence terms should appear on the 7-segment display. The output select input needs to be set to Gold code (high level) in order to test the gold code generator. The load enable input (active-low), as well as the 6 inputs corresponding to the load for the B register can be used to select the sequence to generate. The load value can be set in the 6 load inputs, and then the load enable should be pulsed to perform the load. This can be done with the clock running or stopped, as the load enable is asynchronous. After the load enable is de-asserted, for each clock cycle a new bit of the Gold code sequence should appear in the 7-segment display dot.

## IO

| # | Input        | Output       |
|---|--------------|--------------|
| 0 | clock  | {'segment a': 'Fibonacci hex digit'} |
| 1 | output select (high selects Gold code; low selects Fibonacci LSB marker) & Gold code load value bit 0  | {'segment b': 'Fibonacci hex digit'} |

* Clock 0 Hz
* External hardware Besides interactining with the IOs, nothing is needed

## How it works

The two top bits in each word form the opcode (load, store, add, branch-if-zero) while the remaining four are the immediate field that the opcode uses.  Load and store only access the immediate field of the word.  The IO implements a simple command protocol to reset, load data, load code, and run.  The output are used for the PC and the Accumulator.  The test bench shows how to load a fibonacci computing program.

## How to test

Use the command protocol to load programs and run them (see test bench)

## How it works

The 8 inputs represent the current state of the neighboring cells (0 = dead, 1 = alive). The fate of the cell is in bits 2 and 3 of the output. The cell will be alive if either bit 2 is on and it was alive in the previous generation, or if bit 3 is on. Otherwise, it'll die.

## How to test

Connect 8 DIP switches to the 8 input pins, and LEDs to bits 2 and 3 of the output. Observe the value of the output bits: bit 2 should be on when either two or three of the DIP switches are on, and bit 3 should be on when exactly three DIP switches are on.

* [Extra docs](https://github.com/ElectricPotato/tinytapeout-picture-printer-b/blob/main/README.md)
* Clock 1000 Hz
* External hardware Something to decode and display the image. E.g. An arduino connected to the chip Clock and Pixel Output pins could be used to display the 1s and 0s coming from the chip as '@' and '.' characters in a serial console, putting a newline every 41 characters (41 is the width of the image)

## How it works

It outputs the image pixel by pixel, line by line, left to right, top to bottom. 1 pixel per clock cycle. Image is 41 by 41 pixels. 1 = black pixel, 0 = white pixel.

## How to test

Supply a clock to 1st input and hold 2nd input high for one clock cycle to reset. Everything in the design happens on the rising edge of the clock. Connect external hardware described below.

# 4-bit ALU with 7 segment display decoder hexadecimal output



* Author Michael Gargano
* Description a 4-bit ALU with 8 different possible operations on an internal accumulator whose current 4-bit state is displayed in hexadecimal on the segmented display
* [GitHub project](https://github.com/mgargano/tinytapeout_alu_with_4bit_7segmetdisplay_decoder)
* [Wokwi project](https://wokwi.com/projects/341538994733974098)
* [Extra docs]()
* Clock 0 Hz
* External hardware None

## How it works

3-bit decoder picks operation pass-through, bit-wise (NOT, AND, OR, XOR), two's complement, add, or subtract circuit based on selection and stores the result in a 4-bit accumulator, after the pressing the step button, the 4-bit to 7-segment display decoder circuits then take that value and display it hexadecimal

## How to test

select one of the 8 alu operations [switches 4-2] (pass-through 0, bit-wise NOT 1, bit-wise AND 2, bit-wise OR 3, bit-wise XOR 4, add 5, two's compliment 6, subtract 7) then input a 4-bit number [switches 8-5], press step button to perform the selected computation and the display will indicate current 4-bit accumulator value in hex, dot indicates if a carry is output during addition or subtraction

## IO

| # | Input        | Output       |
|---|--------------|--------------|
| 0 | clock (or single step with step button)  | segment a of hex output |
| 1 | alu operation selection bit 2  | segment b of hex output |
| 2 | alu operation selection bit 1  | segment c of hex output |

# Low-speed UART transmitter with limited character set loading



* Author maehw
* Description 300(?) baud UART transmitter (8N1) with limited character set (0x40..0x5F; includes all capital letters in the ASCII table) loading.
* [GitHub project](https://github.com/maehw/wokwi-verilog-gds-lowspeed-tiny-uart)
* [Wokwi project](https://wokwi.com/projects/341631511790879314)
* [Extra docs](https://github.com/maehw/wokwi-verilog-gds-lowspeed-tiny-uart/blob/main/README.md)
* Clock 300 Hz
* External hardware UART receiver or oscilloscope or logic analyzer (optional)

## How it works

The heart of the design is a 13 bit shift register (built from D flip-flops). When a word has been transmitted, it will be transmitted again and again until a new word is loaded into the shift register or the output is disabled (the word will keep on cycling internally).

## How to test

Load a character into the design and attach a UART receiver (or oscilloscope or logic analyzer) on the output side.

## IO

| # | Input        | Output       |
|---|--------------|--------------|
| 0 | 300 Hz input clock signal (or different value supported by the whole  | UART (serial output pin, direct throughput) |
| 1 | bit b0 (the least significant bit) of the loaded and transmitted character  | UART (serial output pin, gated by enable signal) |
| 2 | bit b1 of the loaded and transmitted character  | UART (serial output pin, reverse polarity, direct throughput) |
| 3 | bit b2 of the loaded and transmitted character  | UART (serial output pin, reverse polarity, gated by enable signal) |
| 4 | bit b3 of the loaded and transmitted character  | UART (MSBit, direct throughput); typically set to 1 or can be used to sniffing the word cycling through the shift register) |
| 5 | bit b4 of the loaded and transmitted character  | UART (MSBit, reverse polarity, direct throughput); same usage as above |
